    <h1>10 Must-Try Mexican Recipes You've Been Missing Out On</h1>
    <h2>Tlayudas</h2>
    <p> The Mexican dishes we know and love—tacos, tamales, burritos, and quesadillas—barely scratch the surface of what this incredible cuisine has to offer. Many dishes skip the usual tortilla-beans-rice trio altogether: Think vibrant soups, messy sandwiches, and a cheesy grilled corn salad. Others are specific to their region, like a shrimp classic from the coastal state of Sinaloa or tortilla pizzas from Oaxaca. All are worth adding to your Mexican meal rotation, especially with these easy, authentic recipes.</p>
